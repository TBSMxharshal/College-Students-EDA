# College-Students-EDA
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a dataset featuring college students from institutions worldwide. The dataset includes details such as college ID, country, total students, gender distribution, average CGPA, annual family income, academic branch, sports participation, research papers published, placement rate, and faculty count. The goal is to uncover trends and insights related to student performance, placement rates, and institutional factors.
